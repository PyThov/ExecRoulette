# ExecRoulette
Execute a random shortcut in a folder (I can't decide what game to play, and neither can anyone else)

Update the <Insert path here> to any path to a folder of executables or shortcuts.
Steam games should be found in: `C:/Users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Steam` for Windows.
